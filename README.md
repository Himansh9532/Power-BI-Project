# Power BI Project: 
## Project Overview

This project aims to [briefly explain the goal of your Power BI project, e.g., visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze sales data, track customer behavior, etc.]. The report/dashboard was developed to provide insights and enable data-driven decision-making in the following areas:

- [Insert a specific use case, e.g., sales performance]
- [Insert a second use case, e.g., customer segmentation]
- [Insert a third use case, e.g., financial forecasting]
  
## Key Features

1. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   The report features interactive visuals including bar charts, line graphs, tables, and KPIs that allow users to filter and drill down into specific data points.

2. **Data Sources**  
   - [Insert Data Source 1, e.g., SQL database]
   - [Insert Data Source 2, e.g., CSV file]
   - [Insert Data Source 3, e.g., Excel sheet]

3. **Metrics and KPIs**  
   The following metrics are tracked in the report:
   - [Metric 1, e.g., Monthly Sales]
   - [Metric 2, e.g., Customer Growth Rate]

4. **Filters and Slicers**  
   The report allows users to filter data by:
   - [Filter 1, e.g., Time period]
   - [Filter 2, e.g., Region]
   - [Filter 3, e.g., Product Category]

## Project Structure

- **Data Model**: The data model was created by connecting multiple datasets and performing data transformations using Power Query. Key relationships and calculated measures were implemented in the data model.
- **Reports**: The following reports/dashboards are included:
  - **Report 1**: [Insert report name, e.g., Sales Overview]
  - **Report 2**: [Insert report name, e.g., Customer Insights]
